			- Converts a polyphonic MIDI stream to a monophonic one by picking only the low, high, or last note.
		- `polyphony`
			- Keeps a running count of the number of active notes, that is, a count of the noteons minus the count of the noteoffs.

		- `set key`
			- Sets the key for an input MIDI message. MIDI messages that have no key are passed through unaltered.
		- `sustain`
			- If the sustain inlet receives a truthy value, it will sustain any succeeding notes by holding their noteoffs until the sustain inlet receives a falsy value.
		- `toggle`
			- Alternate noteon messages of the same key and channel will toggle a note on then off. An event to the release inlet will turn all notes off.
		- `transpose`
			- `macro` that transposes MIDI notes by integer semitones 
		- `tuple to MIDI`
			- Converts a tuple (in the format produced by a MIDI to tuple module) to a MIDI message.
		- `uncouple note`
			- Converts a MIDI note message to an uncoupled note, i.e., on that will not have noteoffs automatically generated for it. Other MIDI messages types are unaltered.
